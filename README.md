=======

A library for working with the BeagleBone in C

Goals
-----

To create a useful library capable of manipulating GPIOs, reading and changing
mux settings, and perhaps in the future using other interfaces such as I2C. It
may contain functionality for working with various special-purpose hardware
such as pixel displays eventually.
